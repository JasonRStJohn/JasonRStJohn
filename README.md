# Hi, Iâ€™m @JasonRStJohn ðŸ‘‹

My primary work is in C#, SQL, and JavaScript. However, much of that is contractually not actually mine to show...

So this is my personal GitHub, where the "other" stuff goes.

JasonRStJohn/JasonRStJohn is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
